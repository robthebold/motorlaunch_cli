# motorlaunch_cli
An interactive text-mode interface to the bimmer_connected library.

This program depends on the https://github.com/m1n3rva/bimmer_connected library. Motorlaunch is not created by or endorsed by m1n3rva, the owner of that project. Install that library per instructions in that project's README. Alternatively, you may also download the python scrips found there to a subdirectory of the location where you have saved motorlaunch.py named 'bimmer_connected'. Bimmer_connected library has different license terms, make sure you agree to those when using it.

Any meaningful use of this project requires internet connectivity, a BMW ConnectedDrive account, and at least one supported BMW or Mini vehicle. This program is subject to internet outages, availability of the BMW Connected Drive servers, and cellular modem connectivity to your vehicle(s).
